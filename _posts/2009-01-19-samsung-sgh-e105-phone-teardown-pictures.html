<p>So, in the vein of <a title="HP Scanner Teardown" href="2009-01-11-hp-scanjet-4470-teardown-with-pictures.html">tearing stuff apart</a>, I ran across some pics I took a while back of my old <a title="SGH-E105 Tech Details on CNET" href="http://reviews.cnet.com/cell-phones/samsung-sgh-e105-t/4505-6454_7-30547546.html">SGH-E105 phone</a>. I'm really hard on my phones, so the case was destroyed after about two years of use. After sourcing a new case off Ebay, I completely disassembled the phone to put the pieces in the new case.</p>
