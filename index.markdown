<h3>About Me</h3>
My name is Robert Ussery, and I'm an electrical engineer in Boulder, Colorado. This blog serves as a repository of projects, thoughts, and anything else that I feel the world might find interesting. When I have time, I dabble in electronics, am a cyclist, and have a revolving door of new hobbies that may appear periodically on this blog. For the most up-to-date information about me, [check my about.me page](http://about.me/RobertUssery)

Professionally, I run an electrical engineering consultancy over at [Oso Electronics LLC](http://www.osoelectronics.com).
